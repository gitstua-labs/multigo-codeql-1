# Date and Time Apps

## Overview

This repository contains two Go applications: `date-app` and `time-app`. These applications demonstrate how to work with dates and times in Go, including creating an in-memory SQLite database, executing SQL queries, and printing the current date and time.

I have added deliberate sql injection errors when calling a sqllite db for a demo

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/date-time-apps.git
